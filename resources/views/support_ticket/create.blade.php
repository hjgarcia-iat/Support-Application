            <p class="text-gray-600">Our dedicated Customer and Product Support Teams are available Monday through
                Friday 9 AM â€“ 6:30 PM EST. All inquiries sent to our Support Department are converted to a ticket,
                immediately receive an automated email confirming receipt, and will receive a response from one of our
                support agents within one business day. When urgent assistance is requested, a response will be provided
                within 4 hours. All incoming inquiries are monitored to ensure our team is providing a timely response
                and resolution. When customers need to speak with a manager, calls will be first handled by the Customer
                Support Supervisor. As needed, calls may be escalated to the Department Manager and finally to the Chief
                Product Officer.</p>
