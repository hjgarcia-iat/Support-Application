<h4>Dear <strong>{{ $first_name }}</strong>:</h4>

<p>Thank you for your interest in Conceptua Math. We received your request for a 20-minute demonstration.
</p>

<p>
    Please email me directly to schedule your webinar. This will be a one-to-one or small group screen sharing session over the web, using GoToMeeting technology. I typically schedule webinars on weekdays between 11:00 am and 5:00 pm eastern time.
</p>

<p>The webinar will present the Conceptua Math curriculum and steer you to free resources that you can use right away. I look forward to hearing from you.

<p>Best Regards,
